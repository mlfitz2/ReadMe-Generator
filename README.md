# ReadMe-Generator

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/mlfitz2/ReadMe-Generator

This project is a program to auto-generate a ReadMe file based on input provided by the user. Once the application is invoked, it prompts the user to answer a series of short questions, and then applies those answers to a ReadMe template. It then generates a ReadMe file based on this information. 

The application was built using JavaScript and Node.js.
